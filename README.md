### Product: Class_WP_ezClasses_API_Twitter_Codebird

##### Jublonet's Codebird - A Twitter library in PHP - gets an ez wrapper.

https://github.com/jublonet/codebird-php

The arc of the intention here is to bypass the usual js based Twitter widget (which can be a page load hog), in order to gain greater 
control over display / layout, as well as use a WP transient to further reduce overhead.

#### IMPORTANT

Make sure your Twitter API credentials do not end up exposed in a public repo. 


#### Overview

Nothing too fancy here. Just an ez way to store your credentials, as well as helpers for pre-processing output.
